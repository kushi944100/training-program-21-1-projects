#### About the project
The Credit Card Fraud Detection Problem includes modeling past credit card transactions with the knowledge of the ones that turned out to be a fraud. This model is then used to identify whether a new transaction is fraudulent or not. Our aim here is to detect 100% of the fraudulent transactions while minimizing the incorrect fraud classifications.

#### Workflow
1. Exploratory Data Analysis was done by Kanchi Tank.
2. Data Processing and Model building was done by Maksuda Rahman Fariya and Nishi Sus.
