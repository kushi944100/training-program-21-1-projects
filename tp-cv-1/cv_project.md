#### About Project 

Our aim is to create a real time face mask detection using opencv and keras. It will detect faces and determine whether they are wearing mask. Due to Covid-19 , there is no efficient face mask detection applications which are now in high demand due to raise of number of cases rapidly.So this project can be used in real time applications which require face-mask detection for safety purposes due to outbreak of Covid-19.In this project we used dataset created by [Prajna Bhandary](https://github.com/prajnasb/observations/tree/master/experiements/data).The dataset consists of 1,376 images belonging to **with mask** and **without mask** 2 classes.Here is the [dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SfUFHPRQfKExx9Ji8HyS4siCwYt9Ov2K/view?usp=sharing)
#### Workflow

* Initially, we collected data for the training model.
* Then there occurred the preprocessing and training phase.
* The training phase completed and the model was created.
* We tested the model by importing in the code of face-detection.
* The output shows if the face detected is wearing mask.
